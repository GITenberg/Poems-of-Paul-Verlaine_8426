      CLAIR DE LUNE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Your soul is as a moonlit landscape fair,
        Peopled with maskers delicate and dim,
     That play on lutes and dance and have an air
        Of being sad in their fantastic trim.

     The while they celebrate in minor strain
        Triumphant love, effective enterprise,
     They have an air of knowing all is vain,&mdash;
        And through the quiet moonlight their songs rise,

     The melancholy moonlight, sweet and lone,
        That makes to dream the birds upon the tree,
     And in their polished basins of white stone
        The fountains tall to sob with ecstasy.

      L' ALLÉE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Powdered and rouged as in the sheepcotes' day,
     Fragile 'mid her enormous ribbon bows,
     Along the shaded alley, where green grows
     The moss on the old seats, she wends her way
     With mincing graces and affected airs,
     Such as more oft a petted parrot wears.
     Her long gown with the train is blue; the fan
     She spreads between her jewelled fingers slim
     Is merry with a love-scene, of so dim
     Suggestion, her eyes smile the while they scan.
     Blonde; dainty nose; plump, cherry lips, divine
     With pride unconscious.&mdash;Subtler, certainly,
     Than is the mouche there set to underline
     The rather foolish brightness of the eye.

      A LA PROMENADE.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The milky sky, the hazy, slender trees,
        Seem smiling on the light costumes we wear,&mdash;
        Our gauzy floating veils that have an air
     Of wings, our satins fluttering in the breeze.

     And in the marble bowl the ripples gleam,
        And through the lindens of the avenue
        The sifted golden sun comes to us blue
     And dying, like the sunshine of a dream.

     Exquisite triflers and deceivers rare,
        Tender of heart, but little tied by vows,
        Deliciously we dally 'neath the boughs,
     And playfully the lovers plague the fair.

     Receiving, should they overstep a point,
        A buffet from a hand absurdly small,
        At which upon a gallant knee they fall
     To kiss the little finger's littlest joint.

     And as this is a shocking liberty,
        A frigid glance rewards the daring swain,&mdash;
        Not quite o'erbalancing with its disdain
     The red mouth's reassuring clemency.

     An ancient terra-cotta Faun,
        A laughing note in 'mid the green,
     Grins at us from the central lawn,
        With secret and sarcastic mien.

     It is that he foresees, perchance,
        A bad end to the moments dear
     That with gay music and light dance
        Have led us, pensive pilgrims, here.

        A balmy zephyr stirs.

     It's Tircis and Aminta,
        Clitandre,&mdash;ever there!&mdash;
     Damis, of melting sonnets
        To many a frosty fair.

     Their trailing flowery dresses,
        Their fine beflowered coats,
     Their elegance and lightness,
        And shadows blue,&mdash;all floats

     And mingles,&mdash;circling, wreathing,
        In moonlight opaline,

        That in the dimmest corner of the park
        So subtly used to smile, bending his arc,
     And sight of whom did us so deeply move

     One day! The other night's wind blew him down!
        The marble dust whirls in the morning breeze.
        Oh, sad to view, o'erblotted by the trees,
     There on the base, the name of great renown!

     Oh, sad to view the empty pedestal!
        And melancholy fancies come and go
        Across my dream, whereon a day of woe
     Foreshadowed is&mdash;I know what will befall!

     Oh, sad!&mdash;And you are saddened also, Sweet,
        Are not you, by this scene? although your eye
        Pursues the gold and purple butterfly
     That flutters o'er the wreck strewn at our feet.

        Of the silence and the shade.

     Let your heart melt into mine,
        And your soul reach out to me,
     'Mid the languors of the pine
        And the sighing arbute-tree.

     Close your eyes, your hands let be
        Folded on your slumbering heart,
     From whose hold all treachery
        Drive forever, and all art.

     Let us with the hour accord!
        Let us let the gentle wind,
     Rippling in the sunburnt sward,
        Bring us to a patient mind!

     And when Night across the air
        Shall her solemn shadow fling,
     Touching voice of our despair,
        Long the nightingale shall sing.

     In the deserted park, silent and vast,
     Erewhile two shadowy glimmering figures passed.

     Their lips were colorless, and dead their eyes;
     Their words were scarce more audible than sighs.

     In the deserted park, silent and vast,
     Two spectres conjured up the buried past.

     "Our ancient ecstasy, do you recall?"
     "Why, pray, should I remember it at all?"

     "Does still your heart at mention of me glow?
     Do still you see my soul in slumber?" "No!"

     "Ah, blessed, blissful days when our lips met!
     You loved me so!" "Quite likely,&mdash;I forget."

     "How sweet was hope, the sky how blue and fair!"
     "The sky grew black, the hope became despair."

     Thus walked they 'mid the frozen weeds, these dead,
     And Night alone o'erheard the things they said.

      SINCE SHADE RELENTS

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Since shade relents, since 'tis indeed the day,
        Since hope I long had deemed forever flown,
     Wings back to me that call on her and pray,
        Since so much joy consents to be my own,&mdash;

     The dark designs all I relinquish here,
        And all the evil dreams. Ah, done am I
     Above all with the narrowed lips, the sneer,
        The heartless wit that laughed where one should sigh.

     Away, clenched fist and bosom's angry swell,
        That knave and fool at every turn abound.
     Away, hard unforgivingness! Farewell,
        Oblivion in a hated brewage found!

     For I mean, now a Being of the Morn
        Has shed across my night excelling rays
     Of love at once immortal and newborn,&mdash;
        By favor of her smile, her glance, her grace,

     I mean by you upheld, O gentle hand,
        Wherein mine trembles,&mdash;led, sweet eyes, by you,
     To walk straight, lie the path o'er mossy land
        Or barren waste that rocks and pebbles strew.

     Yes, calm I mean to walk through life, and straight,
        Patient of all, unanxious of the goal,
     Void of all envy, violence, or hate
        It shall be duty done with cheerful soul.

     And as I may, to lighten the long way,
        Go singing airs ingenuous and brave,
     She'll listen to me graciously, I say,&mdash;
        And, verily, no other heaven I crave.

        On every tree hangs boredom, ripening to its fall,
     Didst gather it, thou smoking yon thy sad cigar,
        Black, casting an incongruous shadow on the wall?

     Thine eyes are just as dead as ever they have been,
        Unchanged is thy grimace, thy dolefulness is one,
     Thou mind'st one of the wan moon through the rigging seen,
        The wrinkled sea beneath the golden morning sun,

     The ancient graveyard with new gravestones every day,&mdash;
        But, come, regale us with appropriate detail,
     Those disillusions weeping at the fountains, say,
        Those new disgusts, just like their brothers, littered stale,

     Those women! Say the glare, the identical dismay
        Of ugliness and evil, always, in all lands,
     And say Love, too,&mdash;and Politics, moreover, say,
        With ink-dishonored blood upon their shameless hands.

     And then, above all else, neglect not to recite
        Thy proper feats, thou dragging thy simplicity
     Wherever people love, wherever people fight,
        In such a sad and foolish kind, in verity!

     Has that dull innocence been punished as it should?
        What say'st thou? Man is hard,&mdash;but woman? And thy tears,

     Ah, others! ah, thyself! Gulled with such curious ease,
        That used to dream (Doth not the soul with laughter fill?)
     One knows not what poetic, delicate decease,&mdash;

     But now what are thy plans, thine aims? Art thou of might?
        Or has long shedding tears disqualified thy heart?
     The tree is scarcely hardy, judging it at sight,
        And by thy looks no topping conqueror thou art.

     So awkward, too! With the additional offence
        Of being now a sort of dazed idyllic bard
     That poses in a window, contemplating thence
        The silly noon-day sky with an impressed regard.

     So totally the same in this extreme decay!
        But in thy place a being with some sense, pardy,
     Would wish at least to lead the dance, since he must pay
        The fiddlers,&mdash;at some risk of flutt'ring passers-by!

     Canst not, by rummaging within thy consciousness,
        Find some bright vice to bare, as 't were a flashing sword?
     Some gay, audacious vice, which wield with dexterousness,
        And make to shine, and shoot red lightnings Heavenward!

     Hast one, or more? If more, the better! And plunge in,
        And bravely lay about thee, indiscriminate,
     And wear that face of indolence that masks the grin
        Of hate at once full-feasted and insatiate.

     Not well to be a dupe in this good universe,
        Where there is nothing to allure in happiness
     Save in it wriggle aught of shameful and perverse,&mdash;
        And not to be a dupe, one must be merciless!

     &mdash;Ah, human wisdom, ah, new things have claimed mine eyes,
        And of that past&mdash;of weary recollection!&mdash;
     Thy voice described, for still more sinister advice,
        All I remember is the evil I have done.

     In all the curious movements of my sad career,
        Of others and myself, the chequered road I trod,
     Of my accounted sorrows, good and evil cheer,
        I nothing have retained except the grace of God!

     If I am punished, 'tis most fit I should be so;
        Played to its end is mortal man's and woman's rôle,&mdash;
     But steadfastly I hope I too one day shall know
        The peace and pardon promised every Christian soul.

     Well not to be a dupe in this world of a day,
        But not to be one in the world that hath no end,
     That which it doth behoove the soul to be and stay
        Is merciful, not merciless,&mdash;deluded friend.

     Cast down thine eyes, poor soul, shut out the unblest:
     A deadliest temptation. Come away.

     All day they flashed in flakes of fire, that lay
     The vintage low upon the hill's green breast,
     The harvest low,&mdash;and o'er that faithfullest,
     The blue sky ever beckoning, shed dismay.

     Oh, clasp thy hands, grow pale, and turn again!
     If all the future savoured of the past?
     If the old insanity were on its way?

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Give ear unto the gentle lay
     That's only sad that it may please;
     It is discreet, and light it is:
     A whiff of wind o'er buds in May.

     The voice was known to you (and dear?),
     But it is muffled latterly
     As is a widow,&mdash;still, as she
     It doth its sorrow proudly bear,

     And through the sweeping mourning veil
     That in the gusts of Autumn blows,
     Unto the heart that wonders, shows
     Truth like a star now flash, now fail.

     It says,&mdash;the voice you knew again!&mdash;
     That kindness, goodness is our life,
     And that of envy, hatred, strife,
     When death is come, shall naught remain.

     It says how glorious to be
     Like children, without more delay,
     The tender gladness it doth say
     Of peace not bought with victory.

     Accept the voice,&mdash;ah, hear the whole
     Of its persistent, artless strain:
     Naught so can soothe a soul's own pain,
     As making glad another soul!

     It pines in bonds but for a day,
     The soul that without murmur bears....
     How unperplexed, how free it fares!
     Oh, listen to the gentle lay!

     "Thus, sheep when first they issue from the fold,
     Come,&mdash;one, then two, then three. The rest delay,
     With lowered heads, in stupid, wondering way,
     Waiting to do as does the one that leads.
     He stops, they stop in turn, and lay their heads
     Across his back, simply, not knowing why."*
     Your shepherd, O my fair flock, is not I,&mdash;
     It is a better, better far, who knows

  'TIS THE FEAST OF CORN

     'Tis the feast of corn, 'tis the feast of bread,
        On the dear scene returned to, witnessed again!
     So white is the light o'er the reapers shed
        Their shadows fall pink on the level grain.

     The stalked gold drops to the whistling flight
        Of the scythes, whose lightning dives deep, leaps clear;
     The plain, labor-strewn to the confines of sight,
        Changes face at each instant, gay and severe.

     All pants, all is effort and toil 'neath the sun,
        The stolid old sun, tranquil ripener of wheat,
     Who works o'er our haste imperturbably on
        To swell the green grape yon, turning it sweet.

     Work on, faithful sun, for the bread and the wine,
        Feed man with the milk of the earth, and bestow
     The frank glass wherein unconcern laughs divine,&mdash;
        Ye harvesters, vintagers, work on, aglow!

     For from the flour's fairest, and from the vine's best,
        Fruit of man's strength spread to earth's uttermost,
     God gathers and reaps, to His purposes blest,
        The Flesh and the Blood for the chalice and host!

     Nothing is changed. I see it all once more:

  MON RÊVE FAMILIER

     My grief, cooling my brow with her tears' gentle stream.

     Is she of favor dark or fair?&mdash;I do not know.
     Her name? All I remember is that it doth flow
     Softly, as do the names of them we loved and lost.

     Her eyes are like the statues',&mdash;mild and grave and wide;
     And for her voice she has as if it were the ghost
     Of other voices,&mdash;well-loved voices that have died.

  A UNE FEMME

     To you these lines for the consoling grace
     Of your great eyes wherein a soft dream shines,
     For your pure soul, all-kind!&mdash;to you these lines
     From the black deeps of mine unmatched distress.

     'Tis that the hideous dream that doth oppress
     My soul, alas! its sad prey ne'er resigns,
     But like a pack of wolves down mad inclines
     Goes gathering heat upon my reddened trace!

     I suffer, oh, I suffer cruelly!
     So that the first man's cry at Eden lost
     Was but an eclogue surely to my cry!

     And that the sorrows, Dear, that may have crossed
     Your life, are but as swallows light that fly
     &mdash;Dear!&mdash;in a golden warm September sky.

     The sun, less hot, looks from a sky more clear;
     The roses in their sleepy loveliness
     Nod to the cradling wind. The atmosphere
     Enfolds us with a sister's tenderness.

     For once hath Nature left the splendid throne
     Of her indifference, and through the mild
     Sun-gilded air of Autumn, clement grown,
     Descends to man, her proud, revolted child.

     She takes, to wipe the tears upon our face,
     Her azure mantle sown with many a star;
     And her eternal soul, her deathless grace,
     Strengthen and calm the weak heart that we are.

     The waving of the boughs, the lengthened line
     Of the horizon, full of dreamy hues
     And scattered songs, all,&mdash;sing it, sail, or shine!&mdash;
     To-day consoles, delivers!&mdash;Let us muse.

     So, then this book is closed. Dear Fancies mine,
     That streaked my grey sky with your wings of light,
     And passing fanned my burning brow, benign,&mdash;
     Return, return to your blue Infinite!

     Thou, ringing Rhyme, thou, Verse that smooth didst glide,
     Ye, throbbing Rhythms, ye, musical Refrains,
     And Memories, and Dreams, and ye beside
     Fair Figures called to life with anxious pains,

     We needs must part. Until the happier day
     When Art, our Lord, his thralls shall re-unite,
     Companions sweet, Farewell and Wellaway,
     Fly home, ye may, to your blue Infinite!

     And true it is, we spared not breath or force,
     And our good pleasure, like foaming steed
     Blind with the madness of his earliest course,
     Of rest within the quiet shade hath need.

     &mdash;For always have we held thee, Poesy,
     To be our Goddess, mighty and august,
     Our only passion,&mdash;Mother calling thee,
     And holding Inspiration in mistrust.

     Ah, Inspiration, splendid, dominant,
     Egeria with the lightsome eyes profound,
     Sudden Erato, Genius quick to grant,
     Old picture Angel of the gilt background,

     Muse,&mdash;ay, whose voice is powerful indeed,
     Since in the first come brain it makes to grow
     Thick as some dusty yellow roadside weed,
     A gardenful of poems none did sow,&mdash;

     Dove, Holy Ghost, Delirium, Sacred Fire,
     Transporting Passion,&mdash;seasonable queen!&mdash;
     Gabriel and lute, Latona's son and lyre,&mdash;
     Ah, Inspiration, summoned at sixteen!

     What we have need of, we, the Poets True,
     That not believe in Gods, and yet revere,
     That have no halo, hold no golden clue,
     For whom no Beatrix leaves her radiant sphere,

     We, that do chisel words like chalices,
     And moving verses shape with unmoved mind,
     Whom wandering in groups by evening seas,
     In musical converse ye scarce shall find,&mdash;

     What we need is, in midnight hours dim-lit,
     Sleep daunted, knowledge earned,&mdash;more knowledge still!
     Is Faust's brow, of the wood-cuts, sternly knit,
     Is stubborn Perseverance, and is Will!

     Is Will eternal, holy, absolute,
     That grasps&mdash;as doth a noble bird of prey
     The steaming flanks of the foredoomed brute,&mdash;
     Its project, and with it,&mdash;skyward, away!

     What we need, we, is fixedness intense,
     Unequalled effort, strife that shall not cease,
     Is night, the bitter night of labor, whence
     Arises, sun-like, slow, the Master-piece!

     Let our Inspired, hearts by an eye-shot tined,
     Sway with the birch-tree to all winds that blow,
     Poor things! Art knows not the divided mind&mdash;
     Speak, Milo's Venus, is she stone or no?

     We therefore, carve we with the chisel Thought
     The pure block of the Beautiful, and gain
     From out the marble cold where it was not,
     Some starry-chitoned statue without stain,

     That one far day, Posterity, new Morn,
     Enkindling with a golden-rosy flame
     Our Work, new Memnon, shall to ears unborn
     Make quiver in the singing air our name!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
